This is a set of Z80 assembly routines and demos to allow a TI-83 Plus calculator to access a PS/2 keyboard or mouse.

Similar code has also ended up in my [BBC BASIC for the Sega Master System project](https://github.com/benryves/BBCBasicSMS),
however what is probably of more relevance is the Keyboard Layout Editor as I've used the same keyboard layout data format in a few other places
(such as the AVR I/O controller in my homebrew computer).
